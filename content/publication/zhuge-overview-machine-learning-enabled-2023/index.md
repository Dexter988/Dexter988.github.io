abstract: To ensure safe usage and robust performance of energy storage batteries,
  accurate state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimations are required.
  Due to recent breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence methods,
  data-driven methods have attracted increased attention. This paper reports state-of-the-art
  research progress in machine learning-enabled methods for SOC and SOH estimations.
  Comprehensive comparisons are made in terms of the dataset, estimation accuracy,
  and battery type to provide a clear picture for SOC and SOH estimation. Moreover,
  the challenges and research opportunities on future SOC and SOH estimation are disclosed.
