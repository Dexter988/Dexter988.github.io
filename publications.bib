  abstract = {In plasma-jet-driven magneto-inertial fusion (PJMIF) systems, a high-voltage nanosecond pulsed power supply is required to drive the plasma gun. Marx bank circuit (MBC) is a good candidate to generate nanosecond pulse with high amplitude, fast rise time, narrow pulse width, and low jitter. However, the fundamental topology and operation principle of a positive nanosecond pulse generator are rarely discussed. In this paper, a comprehensive study on the conduction state of fundamental topology and traditional MBC is presented. Furthermore, an improved positive MBC with auxiliary triggering topology (ATT) is proposed. By changing the switching mode from ``overvoltage switching-on'' to ``triggering switching-on'', the system reliability is improved. The output characteristics under different modified stages, triggering capacitors, and main capacitors are investigated. A 4 {\textbackslash}times 4 MBC prototype is implemented with optimized parameters to validate the feasibility of the proposed concept. With spark gap switch load, it can generate a high-voltage pulse with an amplitude of 5.04kV, a rise time of 12.4ns, and an FWHM of 12.6ns.},

  abstract = {With the advancements in power semiconductors and converters, power electronics based high-voltage pulse generators (HVPG) have emerged due to their advantages of high repetition rate, flexible control, long lifetime, and compact size. However, there is a lack of comprehensive literature review on recent advances in power electronics intensive HVPG technologies. To fill this gap, we present a systematic review on HVPGs. First, HVPGs are classified into different types based on their mechanisms. Each type along with its basic circuits and modifications are introduced. Then, the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of these topologies are summarized. Furthermore, the potential applications of HVPGs are explored. The performance of pulse generators mentioned in the literature and commercial products is listed. Finally, future trends and technical challenges in HVPG design and development are discussed. This paper provides a clear understanding of HVPGs and the inspiration of topologies developments to meet the specific requirements. Current state and potential future directions are discussed and summarized to facilitate evolvements in HVPG technology.},
